        "--*Stop the bleeding*--. ==Put pressure on the cut with a gauze pad or clean cloth. Keep the pressure on for a few minutes.==",
        "--*Clean the wound.*-- ==Once you’ve stopped the bleeding, rinse the cut under cool running water or use a saline wound wash. Clean the area around the wound with soap and a wet washcloth. Don’t get soap in the cut, because it can irritate the skin. And don’t use hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which could irritate the cut.==",
        "--*Remove any dirt or debris*-- ==Use a pair of tweezers cleaned with alcohol to gently pick out any dirt, gravel, glass, or other material in the cut.=="
